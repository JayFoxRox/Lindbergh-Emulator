Lindbergh-Emulator
==================

A Sega Lindbergh environment / HLE for Linux

A lot of the files are still not public yet.

This was once planned to be a commercial emulator. I have to make sure those who worked on it are protected.
The emulator code was written entirely by me, Jannik Vogel.
However, parts of Lindbergh were cracked and reverse engineered by others who shall not be named.
This emulator is also based on Sega and Creative includes which I can not share yet.

The emulator will probably be released and improved in parts over the next couple of months.
